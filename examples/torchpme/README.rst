Learning Capabilities with torchpme
=======================================

This example demonstrates the capabilities of the `torchpme` package, focusing on
learning target charges and utilizing the :class:`CombinedPotential` class to evaluate
potentials that combine multiple pairwise interactions with optimizable ``weights``.
