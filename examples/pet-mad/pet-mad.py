"""
PET-MAD Example
===============

:Authors: Philip Loche `@PicoCentauri <https://github.com/picocentauri>`_,

This example demonstrates how to use the PET-MAD model with ASE,
`i-PI <https://ipi-code.org>` and `LAMMPS <https://lammps.org>`_. 
PET-MAD is a "universal" machine-learning forcefield trained on 
a dataset that aims to incorporate a very high degree of 
structural diversity.

We will first create a Si crystal and then calculate the energy and forces using the PET-MAD
model in ASE. Finally, we will run a molecular dynamics simulation using ASE and LAMMPS.

# Start by importing the required libraries.

#
# Load the model
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# To start the simulation we first have to load the model. We will use the latest
# version of the PET-MAD model from the Huggingface model hub and export to be able to
# make inference with it.

# %%
#
# Initialize the system
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Create silicon crystal and rattle structures slightly to create non zero forces.

atoms = bulk("Si", cubic=True, a=5.43, crystalstructure="diamond")

# %%
#
# To speed the loading process we can also download the model by yourself and load it
# from disk by providing the path to the :py:func:`load_model
# <metatensor.utils.io.load_model>` function.
#
# Single point energy and forces
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# PET-MAD is compatible with the metatensor atomistic model interface which allows us to
# run it with ASE and many other MD engines. For more details see the `metatensor
# documentation
# <https://docs.metatensor.org/latest/atomistic/engines/index.html#atomistic-models-engines>`_.
#
# We now wrap model in ASE compatible calculator and calculate energy and forces.

#
# Here, we run the computation on the CPU.. If you have a CUDA GPU you can also set
# ``device="cuda"`` to speed up the computation.

# Molecular dynamics with ``ASE``
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# We run Langevin molecular dynamics simulation with ASE. The system is being simulated
# at 310 Kelvin with a timestep of 0.5 femtoseconds and for 200 steps (total simulation
# time of 100 femtoseconds).

#
# Molecular dynamics with ``LAMMPS``
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# We now run the same MD with `LAMMPS <https://lammps.org>`_.
#
# To do so, it is only required defining a ``pair_style`` that defines the model and a
# single ``pair_coeff`` command should be used with the metatensor style, specifying the
# mapping from LAMMPS types to the atomic types the model can handle. The first 2
# arguments must be ``* *`` so as to span all LAMMPS atom types. This is followed by a
# list of N arguments that specify the mapping of metatensor atomic types to LAMMPS
# types, where N is the number of LAMMPS atom types.

# We use to the ``collect_extensions`` argument to save the compiled extensions to disk.
# These extensions ensure that the model remains self-contained and can be executed
# without requiring the original Python or C++ source code. This is necessary for the
# LAMMPS interface to work because it has no access to the Python code.
#
# .. warning::
#
#   Be aware that the extensions are compiled files and depend on your operating system.
#   Usually you have re-export the extensions for different systems!
#
# We also save to geometry to a LAMMPS data file and finally run the simulation.
