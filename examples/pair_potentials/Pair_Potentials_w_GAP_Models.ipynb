    "If you find yourself here, it is likely because you want to learn how to compute pair potentials for dimers, subtract these energies and forces from your dataset of structures, and subsequently run simulations with your pair and GAP potentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "If not, I'm afraid you've somehow managed to crawl your way into a very niche area of the vast internet - don't worry, we've all been there, but now it's probably time for you to leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "1. Compute pair potentials using planewave self-consistent calculations (`pw.x`) via Quantum Espresso and compile them into a LAMMPS-readable format. \n",
    "2. Use LAMMPS and the newly-created pair potential to compute energies and forces on your dataset of structures, learning only the correction to our pair potential baseline. \n",
    "3. Run simulations with i-PI using the pair potential (through LAMMPS) and your GAP model (through Librascal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I, Victor Principe, Ph.A., have compiled and written this tutorial, the majority of the functions/work for step 1 was written and prepared by Philip Loche, Ph.D., so make sure to go read and cite his work! "

    "For some background, let's first explain why this is all necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating your GAP potential, you provide the model with a dataset containing many different configurations and/or systems of interest, hopefully with high fidelity quantum mechanical force and energy data to go along with each snapshot. These snapshots are usually provided from configurational sampling of the system(s) in question. The issue is that these simulations likely did not sample any configurational space where atoms are very close together, as repulsive electrostatic forces should have prevented this from occurring. As the model doesn't know anything about physical principles, it naively extrapolates its model to very small interatomic distances. Instead of having an exponential increase in energy at close distances, with exponentially increasing repulsive forces between the two atoms, it models a decrease in energy/forces down to zero below a certain threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now what's the result of this? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if you subsequently use your GAP potential, and an atom pair pass the aforementioned threshold, the model believes the forces become attractive and the atoms will get cosy and collapse in on each other. Suffice to say the this should *definitely not happen in any universe we live in*. Hence, we need to compute and execute a parallel potential between pairs of atoms that knows how forces and energies behave at small interatomic distances, and thereby \"override\" the unphysical predictions of the GAP model."

    "Ok, so it seems like our interpolated forces match -dE/dr at further interatomic distances, but deviate at short distances. This is what will throw up a warning when running calculations using a pair potential that was created on interpolated forces, instead of using the analytical gradient for the forces in the potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the main purpose of our pair potential is to only ensure that atoms do not collapse in on one another when they come to close, and to let the GAP model handle the energy/force predictions for the rest, it is not of great importance if the forces calculated at very close distancs are not fully physically accurate - especially as the pair potential will likely cause repulsion before any dimer reaches the short interatomic disance at which the analytical gradients are not fully physically accurate (usually around 0.25 Angstrom).\n",

As all the structure files have been given the same name, we actually only need to create one input file for the `lmp_mpi` (or `lmp_serial`) executable. This is because you can provide all the pair potentials from the previously-created `potential.table` file, and LAMMPS will only use the ones applicable to your system. Similarly, you can provide the mass of all elements (in this case 4 elements - H,C,N, and O) and LAMMPS will only use the masses corresponding to the elements that are present in your system.

However, my scale is not accurate below a certain (critical) mass, and I have one dolphin that falls below this mass. You, on the other hand, have this fancy scale that is accurate up to this critical mass, but inaccurate above it. So, I give you the light dolphin to weigh, and write down your result. It wouldn't make sense for me to now weigh all the dolphins, as that would mean that your dolphin would be weighed twice. I need to weigh all the dolphins except yours, and then combine results. Voilà - the sum of all the dolphins' mass is equivalent to the total energies and forces in the dataset (previously calculated using DFT-D2), and your dolphin is equivalent to the energies and forces provided by the pair potential. I need to subtract the pair potential energies and forces from the dataset, so that when the two potentials (equivalent to the low and high mass weighing scales) are combined during MD, the energies and forces stack up to the correct sum (total mass of dolphins).*"

All in all, the force and energy predictions actually seem pretty great! But don't give the model too much credit - these are predictions on novel configurations of the same crystals the model was trained on. I'm sure if we made predictions on organic crystals outside the training set it would perform more poorly than Jeff Bezos's tax returns. "

The i-PI input template can be found at `templates/i-pi_input.xml`, and the LAMMPS input can be found at `templates/lammps_md.in`. Let's run dynamics starting from a random ABUJUF configuration, let's say 11. Feel free to change this to your favourite number! The `struct.in` file from this configuration will be added to the `ABUJUF_PIMD/` directory, as that is where we will run simulations.

    "We will be running simulations in the NVT ensemble at 300 K for 100 steps. We will be using only 4 beads for this simulation, just to speed things up. Please note that if you want to run proper statistical sampling, you should use 32 beads for full PIMD (or you can use 6 beads with a PIGLET thermostat). If you look at the `<ffsocket>` sections of the input, you will see that we are using two drivers. The first is the LAMMPS pair potential, which has been attributed to the socket address `lammps`. The second is the GAP potential, which has been attributed to the socket address `gap`. Under the `<forces>` section of the input, it says that each potential has been given a weighting of `1.0`. This is because the LAMMPS energies and forces were subtracted from the dataset used to train the GAP potential, and so the predictions from the two potentials must be summed during simulations to give the total energies and forces."

The simulation seems to be progressing well, although a 100-step simulation is far too short to say that for certain - that would be called *fake news* (unlike telling people to drink bleach to combat COVID).
