Rotating equivariant properties
===============================

This example goes through the rotation of spherical tensor properties.
This basic, but not obvious, technique is useful in the context of
training non-equivariant neural networks with rotational augmentation
or writing tests for equivariant operations within rotationally equivariant
models.
