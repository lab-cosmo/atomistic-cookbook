This tutorial introduces a machine learning (ML) framework
that predicts Hamiltonians for molecular systems. Another 
one of our 'cookbook examples 
<https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/periodic-hamiltonian/periodic-hamiltonian.html>`__
demonstrates an ML model that predicts real-space Hamiltonians
for periodic systems. While we use the same model here to predict 
a molecular Hamiltonians, we further finetune these models to 
optimise predictions of different quantum mechanical (QM)
properties of interest, thereby treating the Hamiltonian 
predictions as an intermediate component of the ML 
framework. More details on this hybrid or indirect learning 
framework can be found in `ACS Cent. Sci. 2024, 10, 637âˆ’648.

# %%
# Within a Hamiltonian learning framework, one could chose to learn
# a target that corresponds to the matrix representation for an
# existing electronic structure method, but in a finite AO basis,
# such a representation will lead to a finite basis set error. 
# The parity plot below illustrates this error by showing the
# discrepancy between molecular orbital (MO) energies of an ethane
# molecule obtained from a self-consistent calculation on a minimal 
# STO-3G basis and the larger def2-TZVP basis, especially for the
# high energy, virtuals MOs.

# %%

#    :alt: Parity plot comparing the MO energies of ethane from a 
#           DFT calculation with the STO-3G and the def2-TZVP basis.
#    :width: 600px

# %%
# The choice of basis set plays a crucial role in determining 
# the accuracy of the observables derived from the predicted 
# Hamiltonian. Although the larger basis sets generally provide
# more reliable results, the computational cost to train such a
# model is very high. Using the indirect learning framework, one
# could instead learn a reduced effective Hamiltonian that reproduces
# calculations from a much larger basis while using a significantly
# simpler and smaller model consistent with a smaller basis.
#

# %%
# We first show an example where we predict the reduced effective
# Hamiltonians for a homogenous dataset of ethane molecule while 
# targeting the MO energies of the def2-TZVP basis. 

# %%
# Python environment and used packages
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# %%
# We start by creating a virtual environment and installing
# all necessary packages. The required packages are provided
# in the environment.yml file that can be dowloaded at the end.
# We can then import the necessary packages.

# Generate reference data
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# In principle one can generate the training data of reference
# Hamiltonians from a given set of structures, using any  
# electronic structure code. Here we provide a pre-computed,
# homogenous dataset that contains 100 different
# configurations of ethane molecule. For all structures, we 
# performed Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT)
# calculations with `PySCF <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf>`_, 
# using the B3LYP functional. For each molecular geometry, we 
# computed the Fock and overlap matrices along with other
# molecular properties of interest, using both STO-3G and def2-TZVP 
# basis sets.

# %%
# Prepare the dataset for ML training
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# In this section, we will prepare the dataset required to
# train our machine learning model using the ``MoleculeDataset`` 
# and ``MLDataset`` classes. These classes help format and store
# the DFT data in a way compatible with our ML package, `mlelec  <https://github.com/curiosity54/mlelec/tree/qm7>`_.
# In this section we initialise the ``MoleculeDataset`` where 
# we specify the molecule name, file paths and the desired targets
# and auxillary data to be used for training for the minimal
# (STO-3G), as well as a larger basis (lb, def2-TZVP).
# Once the molecular data is prepared, we wrap it into an 
# ``MLDataset`` instance. This class structures the dataset 
# into a format that is optimal for ML the Hamiltonians. The 
# Hamiltonian matrix elements depend on specific pairs of 
# orbitals involved in the interaction. When these orbitals
# are centered on atoms, as is the case for localized AO
# bases, the Hamiltonian matrix elements can be viewed
# as objects labeled by pairs of atoms, as well as multiple
# quantum numbers, namely the radial (`n`) and the angular
# (`l`, `m`) quantum numbers characterizing each AO. These
# angular functions are typically chosen to be real spherical 
# harmonics, and determine the equivariant behavior of the 
# matrix elements under rotations and inversions. ``MLDataset`` 
# leverages this equivariant structure of the Hamiltonians, 
# which is discussed in further detail in the `Periodic Hamiltonian Model Example
# <https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/periodic-hamiltonian/periodic-hamiltonian.html>`__
# . Finally, we split the loaded dataset into training, 
# validation and test datasets using ``_split_indices``.

# Computing features that can learn Hamiltonian targets
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# As discussed above the Hamiltonian matrix elements
# are dependent on single as well as two centers. So, 
# to address this we extend the equivariant, SOAP based
# features for the atom-centered desciptors 
# to a descriptor capable of describing multiple atomic centers and
# their connectivities, giving rise to the equivariant pairwise descriptor
# which simultaneously characterizes the environments for pairs of atoms
# in a given system. Our `Periodic Hamiltonian Model Example
# <https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/periodic-hamiltonian/periodic-hamiltonian.html>`__
# discusses the construction of these descriptors in greater detail.
# To construct these atom- and pair-centered features we use our 
# in house library `featomic <https://github.com/metatensor/featomic/>`_
# for each structure in the our dataset using the hyperparameters
# defined below. The features are constructed starting from a
# description of a structure in terms of atom density. The 
# ``density`` hyperparameter lets us chose that. the features are
# discretized on a basis of radial functions and spherical harmonics, 
# which are given by the ``basis`` hyperparameter. The ``cutoff``
# hyperparameter controls the extent of the atomic environment.
# The atom and pairwise features have very similar hyperparameters, 
# except for the cutoff radius, which is larger for pairwise
# features to include as many pairs.

# Prepare Dataloaders
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# To efficiently feed data into the model during training,

# creates data loaders for training, validation and testing.
# The ``model_return="blocks"`` argument determines that the

# decomposed into and the ``batch_size`` argument defines the

#
# Next, we set up our linear model that predicts the Hamiltonian
# matrices, using ``LinerTargetModel``. To improve the model 
# convergence, we first start with a symmetry-adapted ridge regression
# targeting the Hamiltonian matrices from the STO-3G basis QM 
# calculation using the ``fit_ridge_analytical`` function.
# This provides us a more reliable set of weights to initialise the 
# fine-tuning rather than starting from any random guess.

# %%
# Indirect learning of the MO energies
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Now rather than explicitly targeting the Hamiltonian matrix,
# we instead treat it as an intermediate layer in our framework
# and the model weights are subsequently fine-tuned by backpropagating
# a loss on a derived molecular property of the Hamiltonian such as
# the MO energies but from the larger def-TZVP basis instead of the
# STO-3G basis. 
#
# Before fine-tuning, we set up the loss function, optimizer
# and the learning rate scheduler for our model. We use a customized
# mean squared error (MSE) loss function that guides the learning and
# ``Adam`` optimizer that performs a stochastic gradient descent 
# that minimizes the error and the scheduler reduces the learning 
# rate by the given factor if the validation loss plateaus.

# are shown in grey. One can clearly see that even with a 
# minimal basis parametrisation, the model is able to reproduce
# the large basis MO energies with good accuracy. Thus, using 
# an indirect model, makes it possible to promote the model
# accuracy to a higher level of theory, at no additional cost.

# Targeting the Multiple Properties
# ---------------------------------
#
# In principle we can also target multiple properties for
# the indirect training. While MO energies can be computed
# by simply diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix, some 
# properties like the dipole moment require
# the position operator integral and it's derivative if 
# we want to bacpropagate the loss. We therefore interface
# our ML model with an electronic structure code that supports
# automatic differentiation, `PySCFAD <https://github.com/fishjojo/pyscfad>_`,
# an end-to-end auto-differentiable version of PySCF. By
# doing so we delegate the computation of properties to PySCFAD,
# which provides automatic differentiation of observables with
# respect to the intermediate Hamiltonian. In particular, we will now
# indirectly target the dipole moment and polarisability along 
# with the MO energies from a large basis reference calculation


# %%
# Get Data and Prepare Data Set
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# In our last example even though we show an indirect ML model
# that was trained on a homogenous dataset of different 
# configurations of ethane, we can also easily extend the 
# framework to use  a much diverse dataset such as the 
# `QM7 dataset <http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/>_.
# For our next example we select a subset 150 structures from
# this dataset that consists of only C, H, N and O atoms.

# %%
# Set parameters for training
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

# %%
# Set the parameters for the training, including the dataset set size
# and split, the batch size, learning rate and weights for the individual
# components of eigenvalues, dipole and polarisability.
# We additionally define a folder name, in which the results are saved.
# Optionally, noise can be added to the ridge regression fit.
# Here, we now need to provide different weights
# for the different targets (eigenvalues
# :math:`\epsilon`, the dipole moment
# :math:`\mu`, and polarisability
# :math:`\alpha`), which we will use when computing the loss :math:`\mathcal{L}`.
#
# .. math::
#    \mathcal{L}_{\epsilon,\mu,\alpha} = & \;
#    \frac{\omega_{\epsilon}}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{O_n} \
#    \sum_{o=1}^{O_n} \left( \epsilon_{no} - \tilde{\epsilon}_{no} \right)^2 \
#     + \frac{\omega_{\mu}}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{N_A^2} \
#    \sum_{m=1}^{N_A} \left( \mu_{nm} - \tilde{\mu}_{nm} \right)^2 \\
#    & + \frac{\omega_{\alpha}}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{N_A^2} \
#    \sum_{m=1}^{N_A} \left( \alpha_{nm} - \tilde{\alpha}_{nm} \right)^2
#
# where
# :math:`N` is the number of training points,
# :math:`O_n` is the number of MO orbitals in the nth molecule,
# :math:`N_A` is the number of atoms :math:`i`.

# %%
# The weights :math: `\omega` are based on the magnitude of errors
# for different properties, in the end we want each of them to 
# contribute equally to the loss.
# The following values worked well for the QM7 example, but of
# course depending on the system that one investigates another set
# of weights might work better.
