Sample and Feature Selection
============================

This is an example of the selection of a diverse subset of structures
from a dataset of candidates (a collection of barium titanate structures)
using SOAP features and FPS and CUR selection. It then also demonstrates
how the same techniques can be used to select the most relevant features.

It showcases the use of ``featomic`` to compute descriptors for a
database of atomic structures, and ``scikit-matter`` to compute the
FPS and CUR selections. The structures are visualized using ``chemiscope`` widgets.
