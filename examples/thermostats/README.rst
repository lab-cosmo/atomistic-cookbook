Thermostattin molecular dynamics simulations, a primer
======================================================

This example provides some practical guidelines to set up and 
run simulations using different types of (primarily stochastic)
thermostats. It discusses both `i-PI <http://ipi-code.org>`_ and
`LAMMPS <http://lammps.org>`_ as practical codes, and it 
analizes and visualize the output using ``matplotlib`` and 
`chemiscope <https://chemiscope.org>`_.
