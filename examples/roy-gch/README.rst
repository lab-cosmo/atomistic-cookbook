Generalized Convex Hull analysis of the polymorphs of ROY
=========================================================

This is an example of the construction of a generalized convex hull
based on SOAP features, for a dataset containing known (and hypothetical)
polymorphs of 5-methyl-2-[(2-nitrophenyl)amino]-3-thiophenecabonitrile
(ROY).

It showcases the use of ``featomic`` to compute descriptors for a
database of atomic structures, and ``scikit-matter`` to compute the
convex hull. The structures are visualized using ``chemiscope`` widgets.
