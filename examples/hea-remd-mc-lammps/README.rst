Replica-exchange molecular dynamics with Monte-Carlo atom swaps
===============================================================

This example shows how to run the replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD)
with Monte-Carlo (MC) atom swaps in LAMMPS using the high-entropy alloy (HEA)
system as an example. Main purpose of this example is to demonstrate how the
REMD/MC method can be efficiently used to sample the configurational space of
a multi-component system with a large number of atoms to finally achieve the
checmical and spatial relaxation of the system.
