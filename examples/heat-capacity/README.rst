Heat capacity of water from path integral molecular dynamics
============================================================

This example shows how to calculate the constant-volume heat
capacity from a path integral molecular dynamics simulation 
using ``i-PI``. `LAMMPS <http://lammps.org>`_ is used
as the driver for the evaluation of the q-TIP4P/f water model.
