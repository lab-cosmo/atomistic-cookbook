        "## Metadynamics for the Zundel cation\n\nMetadynamics is a method to accelerate sampling of rare events - microscopic processes\nthat are too infrequent to be observed over the time scale (ns-\u00b5s) accessible to\nmolecular dynamics simulations. You can read one of the many excellent reviews\non metadynamics (see e.g.\n[Bussi and Branduardi (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118889886.ch1)),\nor follow a\n[lecture from the PLUMED masterclass](https://www.plumed-tutorials.org/lessons/21/004/data/NAVIGATION.html).\nIn short, during a metadynamics simulation an adaptive biasing potential is\nbuilt as a superimposition of Gaussians centered over configurations that have\nbeen previously visited by the trajectory. This discourages the system from remaining\nin high-probability configurations and accelerates sampling of free-energy barriers.\n\n.. figure:: metad-scheme.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 600px\n\n   A schematic representation of how metadynamics work by adaptively building\n   a repulsive bias based on the trajectory of a molecule, compensating for\n   low-energy regions in the free energy surface.\n\nCrucially, the bias is *not* built relative to the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms,\nbut relative to a lower-dimensional description of the system (so-called collective\nvariables) that are suited to describe the processes being studied.\n\n"

        "### Centroid bias\n\nAnother detail worth discussing is that the metadynamics bias\nis computed exclusively on the *centroid*, the mean position of\nthe ring-polymer beads. This is an extreme form of\nring polymer contraction\n[(Markland and Manolopoulos, J. Chem. Phys. (2008)](http://doi.org/10.1063/1.2953308)\nthat avoids computing for each replica the slowly-varying\nparts of the potential, but is not applied for computational\nsavings. When performing a quantum free-energy calculation it\nis important to distinguish between the free-energy computed\nas the logarithm of the probability of observing a given\nconfiguration (that depends on the distribution of the\nreplicas) and the free-energy taken as a tool to estimate\nreaction  rates $k$ in a transition-state theory\nfashion $k\\propto e^{-\\Delta E^\\ddagger/kT}$,\nwhere the energy barrier $\\Delta E^\\ddagger$\nis better estimated from the distribution of the centroid.\nSee e.g.\n[Habershon et al., Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. (2013)](http://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-physchem-040412-110122)\nfor a discussion of the subtleties involved in estimating\ntransition rates.\nIn practice, performing this contraction step is very easy\nin `i-PI`, because for each `<force>` section - including\nthat corresponding to the bias - it is possible to specify\na different number of replicas.
