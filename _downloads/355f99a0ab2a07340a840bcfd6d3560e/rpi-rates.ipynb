        "## Calculation Workflow\n\nThe calculation of tunneling rates using ring-polymer instanton theory\nis a multi-step procedure that requires the optimization of several\nstationary points on the system\u2019s potential-energy surface.\nThe workflow is not fully automated and therefore involves multiple\nindependent runs of i-PI.\n\nA typical workflow is summarized below:\n\n1. Locate the minima on the physical potential-energy surface to identify\nthe reactant and product states. Compute their Hessians, normal-mode\nfrequencies, and eigenvectors.\n\n2. Find the first-order saddle point corresponding to the transition\nstate and evaluate its Hessian.\n\n3. Obtain an \"unconverged\" instanton by locating the first-order saddle\npoint of the ring-polymer Hamiltonian using N replicas. The chosen\nN should be large enough that the instanton provides a reasonable\ninitial guess for a more converged calculation with a larger number\nof replicas, but small enough to keep the computational cost moderate.\nThis step also provides an approximate Hessian for each replica.\n\n4. Use ring-polymer interpolation to construct an instanton with a\nlarger number of replicas. As a rule of thumb, the number of replicas\ncan be doubled.\n\n5. Re-optimize the instanton by locating the corresponding first-order\nsaddle point.\n\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the instanton is converged with respect\nto the number of replicas.\n\n7. Recompute the Hessian for each replica accurately and evaluate\nthe reaction rate.\n\nIf rates are required at multiple temperatures, it is recommended to\nstart with temperatures close to the crossover temperature and then\ncool sequentially, using the optimized instanton from the previous\ntemperature as the initial guess for the next calculation.\n\n"
