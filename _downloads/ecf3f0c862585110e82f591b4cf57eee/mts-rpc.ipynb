        "\n# Multiple time stepping and ring-polymer contraction\n\n:Authors: Davide Tisi [@DavideTisi](https://github.com/DavideTisi) and\n    Michele Ceriotti [@ceriottm](https://github.com/ceriottm)\n\n\nThis notebook provides an introduction to multiple time stepping and\nring polymer contraction, two closely-related techniques,\nthat are geared towards reducing the cost of calculations by separating\nslowly-varying (and computationally-expensive) components of the potential\nenergy from the fast-varying (and hopefully cheaper) ones.\n\nThe first, `multiple time stepping` or MTS, is a well-established technique\nto avoid evaluating the slowly-varying components at every time step of a MD simulation.\nIt was first introduced in\n[M. Tuckerman, B. J. Berne, and G. J. Martyna,\nJCP 97(3), 1990 (1992)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.463137)\nand can be applied to classical simulations,\ntypically to avoid the evaluation of long-range electrostatics in classical\nempirical potentials.\n\nThe second, named `ring polymer contraction`, was first introduced in\n[T. E. Markland and D. E. Manolopoulos, JCP 129(2),\n024105 (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2953308) and\ncan be seen as performing a similar simplification `in imaginary time`,\nevaluating the expensive part of the potential on a smaller number\nof PI replicas.\n\nThe techniques can be combined, which reduces even further the\ncomputational effort, which is the case we demonstrate in this\nnotebook. This dual approach was introduced in\n[V. Kapil, J. VandeVondele, and M. Ceriotti, JCP 144(5),\n054111 (2016)]((https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4941091)\nand [O. Marsalek and T. E. Markland, JCP 144(5),\n(2016)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4941093).\nIt is worth stressing that MTS and/or RPC can also be used very conveniently\ntogether with machine-learning potentials\n(see e.g. [V. Kapil, J. Behler, and M. Ceriotti, JCP 145(23),\n234103 (2016](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4971438) or\n[K. Rossi et al., JCTC 16(8), 5139 (2020)](http://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00362)\nfor early applications).\n\nIf you need an introduction to path integral simulations,\nor to the use of [i-PI](http://ipi-code.org), which is the\nsoftware which will be used to perform simulations, you can see\n[this introductory recipe](https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/path-integrals/path-integrals.html).\n"

This is usually written as\n$V=V_\\mathrm{sr} +V_\\mathrm{lr}$, although in many cases $V_\\mathrm{sr}$\nis a cheap approximation of the potential, and $V_\\mathrm{lr}$\nis taken to be the difference between this potential and the full one.\n\n.. figure:: pimd-mts-pots.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 500px\n\n   A smooth and rough potential components combine to form the total potential\n   energy function used in a simulation.\n\n"
