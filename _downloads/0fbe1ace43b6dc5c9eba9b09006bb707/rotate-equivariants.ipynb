        "## The quaternionic library\nThe [quaternionic](https://quaternionic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library\nis a Python library for working with quaternions and much more. In our case,\nwe will use it to calculate Wigner D matrices, which are essential to rotate\nequivariant spherical tensors.\n\nThree remarks before beginning:\n- Scipy uses a different notation (``[x,y,z,w]``) for quaternions\n  from the one in quaternionic (``[x,y,z,w]``)\n\n- It is also useful to have a clear convention for the matrices that we use. Among the\n  most common cases we have the standard convention x-y-z from the left to right\n  and from the top to bottom. However, when dealing with irreducible components of the\n  angular momentum, we will use a -1, 0, 1 convention, that makes the Wigner\n  D-matrices more readable. When used in the context of real spherical harmonics, the\n  identification is realized by the following scheme:\n\n    + $y \\longleftrightarrow -1$\n    + $z \\longleftrightarrow 0$\n    + $x \\longleftrightarrow 1$\n\n  which then is represented by y-z-x convention.\n\n- If the only difference between two quaternions is their sign, they represent the\n  same rotation. When this happens, we can just check their scalar product: if it\n  is negative (and it should be -1 when this happens) then we can invert the sign\n  of one of the two quaternions.\n\n"
