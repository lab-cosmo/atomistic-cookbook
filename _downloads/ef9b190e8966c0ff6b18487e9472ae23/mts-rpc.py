Multiple time stepping and ring-polymer contraction
===================================================

This notebook provides an introduction to multiple time stepping and
ring polymer contraction, two closely-related techniques,
that are geared towards reducing the cost of calculations by separating
slowly-varying (and computationally-expensive) components of the potential
energy from the fast-varying (and hopefully cheaper) ones.

The first, `multiple time stepping` or MTS, is a well-established technique
to avoid evaluating the slowly-varying components at every time step of a MD simulation.
It was first introduced in
`M. Tuckerman, B. J. Berne, and G. J. Martyna,
JCP 97(3), 1990 (1992) <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.463137>`_
and can be applied to classical simulations,
typically to avoid the evaluation of long-range electrostatics in classical
empirical potentials.

The second, named `ring polymer contraction`, was first introduced in
`T. E. Markland and D. E. Manolopoulos, JCP 129(2),
024105 (2008) <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2953308>`_ and
can be seen as performing a similar simplification `in imaginary time`,
evaluating the expensive part of the potential on a smaller number
of PI replicas.

The techniques can be combined, which reduces even further the
computational effort, which is the case we demonstrate in this
notebook. This dual approach was introduced in
`V. Kapil, J. VandeVondele, and M. Ceriotti, JCP 144(5),
054111 (2016) <(https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4941091>`_
and `O. Marsalek and T. E. Markland, JCP 144(5),
(2016) <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4941093>`_.
It is worth stressing that MTS and/or RPC can also be used very conveniently
together with machine-learning potentials
(see e.g. `V. Kapil, J. Behler, and M. Ceriotti, JCP 145(23),
234103 (2016 <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4971438>`_ or
`K. Rossi et al., JCTC 16(8), 5139 (2020)
<http://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00362>`_
for early applications).

If you need an introduction to path integral simulations,
or to the use of `i-PI <http://ipi-code.org>`_, which is the
software which will be used to perform simulations, you can see
`this introductory recipe
<https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/path-integrals/path-integrals.html>`_.

# Multiple time stepping in real and imaginary time
# -------------------------------------------------
#
# The core underlying assumption in these techniques is that the potential
# can be decomposed into a short-range/fast-varying/computationally-cheap
# part :math:`V_\mathrm{sr}` and a long-range/slow-varying/computationally-expensive
# part :math:`V_\mathrm{lr}`.  This is usually written as
# :math:`V=V_\mathrm{sr} +V_\mathrm{lr}`, although in many cases :math:`V_\mathrm{sr}`
# is a cheap approximation of the potential, and :math:`V_\mathrm{lr}`
# is taken to be the difference between this potential and the full one.
#

#
#    A smooth and rough potential components combine to form the total potential
#    energy function used in a simulation.

# %%
# The way this is realized in practice is by splitting the propagation of
# Hamilton's equations into an inner loop that uses the fast/cheap force,
# and an outer loop that applies the slow force, using a larger time step
# (and therefore giving a larger "kick").
#
# .. math::
#
#   \begin{split}
#   &p \leftarrow p + f_\mathrm{lr} \, dt/2 \\
#   &\left.
#   \begin{split}
#   &p \leftarrow p + f_\mathrm{sr} \, dt/2M \\
#   &q \leftarrow q + p \, dt/M \\
#   &p \leftarrow p + f_\mathrm{sr} \, dt/2M \\
#   \end{split}
#   \right\} M\ \mathrm{times}\\
#   &p \leftarrow p + f_\mathrm{lr} \, dt/2 \\

#    forces in a multiple time step molecular dynamics algorithm
#
# This approach can (and usually is) complemented by aggressive
# thermostatting, which helps stabilize the dynamics in the
# limit of large :math:`M`.
# For a detailed discussion on how thermostatting aids
# in this context, see:
# `J. A. Morrone, T. E. Markland, M. Ceriotti, and B. J. Berne,
# JCP 134(1), 14103 (2011) <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3518369>`_

# The idea behind ring-polymer contraction is very similar:
# it is unnecessary to evaluate on a very fine-grained discretization
# of the path integral components of the potential that are slowly-varying.

#
# As shown in the figure below, ring-polymer contraction
# is realized by computing a Fourier interpolation of the bead positions,
# :math:`\tilde{\mathbf{q}}^{(k)}`, and then evaluating the total potential
# that enters the ring-polymer Hamiltonian as
#
# .. math::
#
#    V(\mathbf{q}) = \sum_{k=1}^P V_\mathrm{sr}(\mathbf{q}^{(k)}) + \frac{P}{P'}
#      \sum_{k=1}^{P'} V_\mathrm{lr}(\tilde{\mathbf{q}}^{(k)})
#
# where :math:`P` and :math:`P'` indicate the full
# and contracted discretizations of the path.

# %%
# A reference calculation using PIGLET
# ------------------------------------
#
# First, let's run a reference calculation without RPC or MTS.
# These calculations will be performed using the q-TIP4P/f water model
# (`S. Habershon, T. E. Markland, and D. E. Manolopoulos, JCP 131(2),
# 24501 (2009) <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3167790>`_)
# that contains a Morse-potential anharmonic intra-molecular potential,
# and an inter-molecular potential based on a Lennard-Jones term and a 4-point
# electrostatic model (the venerable TIP4P idea).
# It is fitted to reproduce experimental properties of water
# `when performing PIMD calculations`
# and it captures nicely several subtle effects while being cheap and easy-to-implement.
# The input for this run is `h2o_pimd.xml`, and we will use the
# `-m qtip4pf` option of `i-pi-driver` to compute the appropriate potential.
# To make simulations run quickly, we use a small box containing only 32
# water molecules, and use a `PIGLET` thermostat that yields converged
# quantum properties with only 8 beads (cf.
# `M. Ceriotti and D. E. Manolopoulos, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109(10), 100604
# (2012) <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.100604>`_,
# and also this `introduction to the PIGLET method
# <https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/path-integrals/path-integrals.html#accelerating-pimd-with-a-piglet-thermostat>`_).
# For simplicity, we use the constant-volume `NVT` ensemble, but you can easily
# modify the input to perform constant-pressure simulations.
#
# The important parts of the simulation
# - which we will modify to run a RPC/MTS simulation -
# are the definition of the forcefield socket

# from source. We use a utility function to compile it. Note that this requires
# a functioning build system with `gfortran` and `make`.

# We are going to launch i-PI from here, and put it in background

#    for i in `seq 1 4`; do
#        i-pi-driver -u -a qtip4pf -m qtip4pf -v &> log.driver.$i &
#    done
#

# ----------------------
#
# Let's now run a classical MD simulation, with and without multiple time stepping.

# Note the different names of the sockets (that have to match the `-a`
# option in the invocation of the driver) and the internal labels that
# will be referred to in the `<forces>` section.

# Each `<force>` block contains a `<mts_weights>` section.
# This provides a list of weights that determine which force
# components are active at each level of the MTS hierarchy.
# These weights indicate that the smooth part (full minus short-range)
# is active in the outer loop, and the short-range part is active in the inner
# loop. Note that the implementation is smart enough to re-use the short-range
# potential computed in the inner loop, multiplying it with a weight of -1 to
# compute :math:`V_\mathrm{lr}=V-V_\mathrm{sr}`.

# One final detail, is that we print out the two components of the potential.
# This is achieved adding `pot_component{units}(idx)` to the `<properties>` field.
# The index corresponds to the order by which the `<force>`

# (with `-m qtip4pf-sr`). This means that we will have to compute
# the slowly-varying part as :math:`V_\mathrm{full}-V_\mathrm{sr}`.
# Let's look at the key sections in the input file. Much as for the

# There are three components here.
# The first computes a full `qtip4pf` potential,

# A second component is also evaluated on a
# contracted ring polymer, and is used to subtract
# the short-range component to leave the (smoother) long-range part.
# This is achieved linking to the `qtip4pf-sr` forcefield,

# term from the total potential.
# Finally, there is another `qtip4pf-sr` component,
# that is evaluated on the full `nbeads='8'` ring polymer.
# The result is a RPC setup in which the smooth
# (Lennard-Jones + Coulomb) part of the potential
# is contracted on 2 replicas, and the fast part is
# computed on 8 replicas, which (thanks to the use of
# a PIGLET thermostat) is enough to achieve a good
# degree of convergence for water at 300 K.
#
# Each `<force>` block also contains a `<mts_weights>` section,
