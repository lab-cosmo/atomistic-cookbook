See [this review](http://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00674)\nfor an overview of the impact of quantum nuclei on the properties of water.\nFrom a computational perspective, this means that it is necessary to use\nspecialized simulations and estimators to evaluate the correct value.\n\n"

        "### Running the PIMD calculation\n\nThis follows the same steps as the ``path-integrals`` example. One important\ndifference is that we will request the ``scaledcoords`` output to the relevant\nsection of the ``i-PI`` input XML file, which\ncontains estimators that can be used to calculate the total energy and\nheat capacity as following\n[Yamamoto, J. Chem. Phys. (2005)](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505109).\n\nThe input file is shown below. It should be noted that ``scaledcoords``\nis given a finite differences displacement as a parameter. This is necessary\nas the estimators require higher order derivatives of the potential energy,\nwhich are calculated using finite differences. This also means that\nevaluating the estimator adds substantial overhead (so it is wise to only\ncompute it every few simulation steps, to eliminate correlations between\nsnapshots) and that one should be careful to use well-converged simulation\nparameters to avoid discontinuities and noise (for instance, we increase\nthe accuracy of the particle-mesh electrostatic calculation, and use a\nshifted Lennard-Jones potential to avoid a discontinuity at the cutoff).\n\n"
