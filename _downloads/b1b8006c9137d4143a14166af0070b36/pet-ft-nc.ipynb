        "\n# Conservative fine-tuning for a PET model\n\n:Authors: Michele Ceriotti [@ceriottm](https://github.com/ceriottm/),\n          Sofiia Chorna [@sofiia-chorna](https://github.com/sofiia-chorna)\n\nThis example demonstrates a \"conservative fine-tuning\" (or equivalently,\n\"non-conservative pre-training\") strategy, to train a model using a (faster)\ndirect, non-conservative force prediction, and then fine-tune it\nin back-propagation force mode to achieve an accurate conservative model.\n\nAs discussed in [this paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=OEl3L8osas), while\nconservative MLIPs are generally better suited for physically accurate simulations,\nhybrid models that support direct non-conservative force predictions can accelerate\nboth training and inference.\nWe demonstrate this practical compromise through a two-stage approach:\nfirst train a model to predict non-conservative forces directly (which avoids the cost\nof backpropagation) and then fine-tuning its energy head to produce conservative\nforces. This two-step strategy is usually faster, and produces a model that can\nexploit both types of force predictions.\nAn example of how to use direct forces in molecular dynamics simulations\nsafely (i.e. avoiding unphysical behavior due to lack of energy conservation)\nis provided in [this example](https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/pet-mad-nc/pet-mad-nc.html).\n\nIf you are looking for a traditional \"post-fact\" fine-tuning strategy, see for example\n[this recipe](https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/pet-finetuning/pet-ft.html).\nNote also that the models generated in this example are run for a too short time to\nproduce a useful model, and reveal the advantages of this direct-force pre-training\nstrategy. The data file contains also \"long\" training settings, which\ncan be used (preferably on a GPU) to train a model up to a point that reveals\nthe behavior of the method in more realistic conditions.\n"

        "## Non-conservative force training\n\n`metatrain` provides a convenient interface to train a PET model with\nnon-conservative forces. You can see the [metatrain documentation](https://metatensor.github.io/metatrain) for general examples of how\nto use this tool.\nThe key step to add non-conservative forces is to add a\n``non_conservative_forces`` section to the ``targets`` specifications of\nthe YAML file describing the training exercise\n\n.. literalinclude:: nc_train_options.yaml\n  :language: yaml\n\nAdding a ``non_conservative_forces`` target automatically adds a\nvectorial output to the atomic heads of the model, but does not\ndisable the energy head, which is still used to compute the energy,\nand could in principle be used to compute conservative forces.\nTo profit from the speed up of direct force evaluation, we specify\n``forces: off`` in the ``energy`` taget.\n\nTraining can be run from the command line using the `mtt` command:\n\n```bash\nmtt train nc_train_options.yaml -o nc_model.pt\n```\nor from Python:\n\n"
