eon
===

eOn is a distributed client-server architecture for rare event simulations,
specifically designed for finding saddle points and exploring potential energy
surfaces over long time scales. It implements methods such as Adaptive Kinetic
Monte Carlo (AKMC), Nudged Elastic Band (NEB), and dimer searches. The core
client is written in C++ for performance, while the server and Python interface
manage the state. Learn more about it on its `homepage <https://eondocs.org>`_
or `the github repository <https://github.com/TheochemUI/EONgit>`_.
