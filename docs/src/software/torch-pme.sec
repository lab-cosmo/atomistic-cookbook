torch-pme
=========

`torch-pme <https://lab-cosmo.github.io/torch-pme/>`_
provides a modular implementation of classical algorithms
for the evaluation of long-range interactions (e.g. Ewald,
particle-mesh Ewald - PME, and P3M). 
It can be used to build traditional electrostatic models,
as well as long-range descriptors for machine-learning
applications.
