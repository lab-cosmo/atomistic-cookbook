LAMMPS
======

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics (MD) code, with a focus on materials
simulations. It includes a wealth of interatomic potentials, and of basic and
advanced molecular simulations techniques, and is highly parallelized using an
efficient domain decomposition scheme. Learn more about LAMMPS on its `homepage
<https://www.lammps.org>`_.
