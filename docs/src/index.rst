The Atomistic Cookbook
======================

The cookbook contains recipes for atomic-scale modelling of materials and
molecules, with a particular focus on machine learning and statistical
sampling methods.
Many of the examples rely heavily on software developed by the laboratory of
computational science and modeling (COSMO, see its `github page
<https://github.com/lab-cosmo>`_) but the cookbook is open for recipes using
all types of modeling tools and techniques.
Rather than focusing on the usage of a specific package, this cookbook provides
examples of the solution of concrete modeling problems, often using a combination
of several tools.

You can view the recipes online, compiled as webpages containing explanations,
code snippets, plots and interactive viewers based on
`chemiscope <https://chemiscope.org>`_. However, it is also possible (and
hopefully simple) to download scripts, and `conda environments
<https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html>`_,
to run the recipe on your computer. You can use these as a starting point and
a template that can be easily adapted to your own use case.
