Nuclear quantum effects
=======================

Most atomistic simulations treat nuclei as classical particles, that sample a
Boltzmann distribution. This approximation breaks down for light nuclei
(hydrogen above all) and high-frequency vibrations, requiring more sophisticated
statistical sampling to compute accurate statistical and dynamical properties.
