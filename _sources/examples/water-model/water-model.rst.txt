Atomistic Water Model for Molecular Dynamics
============================================

:Authors: Philip Loche `@PicoCentauri <https://github.com/picocentauri>`_,
          Marcel Langer `@sirmarcel <https://github.com/sirmarcel>`_ and
          Michele Ceriotti `@ceriottm <https://github.com/ceriottm>`_

In this example, we demonstrate how to construct a `metatomic model
<https://docs.metatensor.org/metatomic>`_ for flexible three and four-point water
model, with parameters optimized for use together with quantum-nuclear-effects-aware
path integral simulations (cf. `Habershon et al., JCP (2009)
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3167790>`_). The model also demonstrates the use of
``torch-pme``, a Torch library for long-range interactions, and uses the resulting model
to perform demonstrative molecular dynamics simulations.

The q-TIP4P/F Model
-------------------

The q-TIP4P/F model uses simple (quasi)-harmonic terms to describe intra-molecular
flexibility - with the use of a quartic term being a specific feature used to describe
the covalent bond softening for a H-bonded molecule - a Lennard-Jones term describing
dispersion and repulsion between O atoms, and an electrostatic potential between
partial charges on the H atoms and the oxygen electron density. For a four-point
model, the oxygen charge is slightly displaced from the oxygen's position, improving
properties like the `dielectric constant <http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp410865y>`_. The
fourth point, referred to as ``M``, is implicitly derived from the other atoms of each
water molecule.

Intra-molecular interactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The molecular bond potential is usually defined as a harmonic potential
of the form

.. math::

  V_\mathrm{bond}(r) = \frac{k_\mathrm{bond}}{2} (r - r_0)^2

Here, :math:`k_\mathrm{bond}` is the force constant and :math:`r_0` is the equilibrium
distance. Bonded terms like this require defining a *topology*, i.e. a list of
pairs of atoms that are actually bonded to each other.

q-TIP4P/F doesn't use a harmonic potential but a quartic approximation of a Morse
potential, that allows describing the anharmonicity of the O-H covalent bond, and how
the mean distance changes due to zero-point fluctuations and/or hydrogen bonding.

.. math::

  V_\mathrm{bond}(r) = \frac{k_r}{2} [(r-r_0)^2-\alpha_r (r-r_0)^3 +
      \frac{7}{12}\alpha_r^2(r-r_0)^4]

.. note::

  The harmonic coefficient is related to the coefficients in the original paper
  by :math:`k_r=2 D_r \alpha_r^2`.

The parameters reproduce the form of a Morse potential close to the minimum, but
avoids the dissociation of the bond, due to the truncation to the quartic term. These

The harmonic angle potential describe the bending of the HOH angle, and is usually
modeled as a (curvilinear) harmonic term, defined based on the angle

Lennard-Jones Potential
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential describes the interaction between a pair of neutral
atoms or molecules, balancing dispersion forces at longer ranges and repulsive forces
at shorter ranges. The LJ potential is defined as:

.. math::

 V_\mathrm{LJ}(r) = 4 \epsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{12} - \left(
 \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^6 \right]

where :math:`\epsilon` is the depth of the potential well and :math:`\sigma` the
distance at which the potential is zero. For water there is usually only an
oxygen-oxygen Lennard-Jones potential.

We implement the Lennard-Jones potential as a function that takes distances, along
with the parameters ``sigma``, ``epsilon``, and ``cutoff`` that indicates the distance
at which the interaction is assumed to be zero. To ensure that there is no
discontinuity an offset is included to shift the curve so it is zero at the cutoff
distance.

horizontal line.

Electrostatic Potential
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The long-ranged nature of electrostatic interactions makes computing them
in simulations non-trivial. For periodic systems the Coulomb energy is given by:

.. math::

 V_\mathrm{Coulomb} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} \sideset{}{'}\sum_{\boldsymbol n \in
  \mathcal{Z}} \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}
  \frac{q_i q_j}{\left|\boldsymbol r_{ij} + \boldsymbol{n L}\right|}

The sum over :math:`\boldsymbol n` takes into account the periodic images of the
charges and the prime indicates that in the case :math:`i=j` the term :math:`n=0` must
be omitted. Further :math:`\boldsymbol r_{ij} = \boldsymbol r_i - \boldsymbol r_j` and
:math:`\boldsymbol L` is the length of the (cubic)simulation box.

Since this sum is conditionally convergent it isn't computable using a direct sum.
Instead the Ewald summation, published in 1921, remains a foundational method that
effectively defines how to compute the energy and forces of such systems. To further
speed the methods, mesh based algorithm suing fast Fourier transformation have been
developed, such as the Particle-Particle Particle-Mesh (P3M) algorithm. For further
details we refer to a paper by `Deserno and Holm
<https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.477414>`_.

We use a *Torch* implementation of the P3M method within the ``torch-pme`` package.
The core class we use is the :class:`torchpme.P3MCalculator` class - you can read more
and see specific examples in the `torchpme documentation
<https://lab-cosmo.github.io/torch-pme>`_ As a demonstration we use two
charges in a cubic cell, computing the electrostatic energy as a function of distance

The hydrogen charge is derived from the oxygen charge as :math:`q_H = -q_O/2`. The
``smearing`` and ``mesh_spacing`` parameters are the central parameters for P3M and
are crucial to ensure the correct energy calculation. We now compute the electrostatic
energy between two point charges using the P3M algorithm.

The potential shape may appear unusual due to computations within a periodic box. For
small distances, the potential behaves like :math:`1/r`, but it increases again as
charges approach across periodic boundaries.

.. note::

  In most water models, Coulomb interactions within each molecule are excluded, as
  intramolecular energies are already parametrized by the bond and angle interactions.
  Therefore, in our model defined below we first compute the electrostatic energy of
  all atoms and then subtract interactions between bonded atoms.

Implementation as a TIP4P/f ``torch`` module
----------------------------------------------

In order to implement a Q-TIP4P/f potential in practice, we first build a class that
follows the interface of a *metatomic* model. This requires defining the atomic
structure in terms of a :class:`metatomic.torch.System` object - a simple
container for positions, cell, and atomic types, that can also be enriched with one or
more :class:`metatomic.torchist` objects holding neighbor
distance information. This is usually provided by the code used to perform a
simulation, but can be also computed explicitly using ``ase`` or `vesin
<https://luthaf.fr/vesin/latest/index.html>`_, as we do here.

For running our simulation we use a small waterbox containing 32 water molecules.

Helper functions for molecular geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to compute the different terms in the Q-TIP4P/f potential, we need to extract
some information on the geometry of the water molecule. To keep the model class clean,
we define a helper functions that do two things.

First, it computes O-H covalent bond lengths and angle. We use heuristics to identify
the covalent bonds as the shortest O-H distances in a simulation. This is necessary
when using the model with an external code, that might re-order atoms internally (as
is e.g. the case for LAMMPS). The heuristics here may fail in case molecules get too
close together, or at very high temperature.

Second, it computes the position of the virtual "M sites", the position of the O
charge in a TIP4P-like model. We also need distances to compute range-separated
electrostatics, which we obtain manipulating the neighbor list that is pre-attached to
the system. Thanks to the fact we rely on ``torch`` autodifferentiation mechanism, the
forces acting on the virtual sites will be automatically split between O and H atoms,
in a way that is consistent with the definition.

Forces acting on the M sites will be automatically split between O and H atoms, in a
way that is consistent with the definition.

Defining the model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Armed with these functions, the definitions of bonded and LJ potentials, and the
:class:`torchpme.P3MCalculator` class, we can define with relatively small effort the
actual model. We do not hard-code the specific parameters of the Q-TIP4P/f potential
(so that in principle this class can be used for classical TIP4P, and - by setting
``m_gamma`` to one - a three-point water model).

A few points worth noting: (1) As discussed above we define a bare Coulomb potential
(that pretty much computes :math:`1/r`) which we need to subtract the molecular "self
electrostatic interaction"; (2) units are expected to be Å for distances, kcal/mol for
energies, and radians for angles; (3) model parameters are registered as ``buffers``;
(4) P3M parameters can also be given, in the format returned by
:func:`torchpme.tuning.tune_p3m`.

The ``forward`` call is a relatively straightforward combination of all the helper
functions defined further up in this file, and should be relatively easy to follow.

This model can be wrapped into a
:class:`metatomic.torch.AtomisticModel` class, that provides
useful helpers to specify the capabilities of the model, and to save it as a
``torchscript`` module.

Model options include a definition of its units, and a description of the quantities
it can compute.

  We need to specify that the model has infinite interaction range because of the
  presence of a long-range term that means one cannot assume that forces decay to zero

Using the Q-TIP4P/f model
-------------------------

The ``torchscript`` model can be reused with any simulation software compatible with
the ``metatomic`` API. Here we give a couple of examples, designed to demonstrate the
usage more than to provide realistic use cases.

Geometry optimization with ``ase``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We begin with an example based on an ``ase``-compatible calculator. To this end,
``metatomic`` provides a compatible
:class:`metatomic.torch.MetatomicCalculator` wrapper to a model. Note how
the metadata associated with the model are used to convert energy into the units
expected by ``ase`` (eV and Å).

Path integral molecular dynamics with ``i-PI``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use `i-PI <http://ipi-code.org>`_ to perform path integral molecular-dynamics
simulations of bulk water to include nuclear quntum effects. See `this recipe
<https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/thermostats/thermostats.html>`_ for an
introduction to constant-temperature MD using i-PI.

First, the ``XML`` input of the i-PI simulation is created using a few utility
functions. This input could also be written to file and used with the command-line
version of i-PI. We use the structure twice to generate a path integral with two
replicas: this is far from converged, see also `this recipe
<https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/path-integrals/path-integrals.html>`_ if you
have never run path integral simulations before.

Molecular dynamics with ``LAMMPS``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``metatomic`` model can also be run with `LAMMPS <https://lammps.org>`_
and used to perform all kinds of atomistic simulations with it.
This only requires defining a ``pair_metatomic`` potential, and specifying
the mapping between LAMMPS atom types and those used in the model.

Note also that the ``metatomic`` interface takes care of converting the
model units to those used in the LAMMPS file, so it is possible to use
energies in eV even if the model outputs kcal/mol.

This specific example runs a short MD trajectory, using a Langevin thermostat. Given
that this is a classical MD trajectory, we use the SPC/Fw model that is fitted to
reproduce (some) water properties even with a classical description of the nuclei.

We save to geometry to a LAMMPS data file and run the simulation
