Statistical sampling and dynamics
=================================

This section contains recipes that compute thermodynamic averages by sampling,
evaluates dynamical properties, or otherwise computes the properties of a
set of configurations of an atomistic system.

                :alt: This is an example how to perform single point calculations based on list of structures using CP2K using its reftraj functionality. The inputs are a set of structures in :download:`example.xyz` using the DFT parameters defined in :download:`reftraj_template.cp2k`. The reference DFT parameters are taken from Cheng et al. Ab initio thermodynamics of liquid and solid water 2019. Due to the small size of the test structure and convergence issues, we have decreased the size of the CUTOFF_RADIUS from 6.0\,\mathrm{Å} to 3.0\,\mathrm{Å}. For actual production calculations adapt the template!

                :alt: This notebook provides an introduction to multiple time stepping and ring polymer contraction, two closely-related techniques, that are geared towards reducing the cost of calculations by separating slowly-varying (and computationally-expensive) components of the potential energy from the fast-varying (and hopefully cheaper) ones.

Habershon et al., JCP (2009)). The model also demonstrates the use of torch-pme, a Torch library for long-range interactions, and uses the resulting model to perform demonstrative molecular dynamics simulations.
