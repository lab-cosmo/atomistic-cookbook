Nuclear quantum effects
=======================

Most atomistic simulations treat nuclei as classical particles, that sample a
Boltzmann distribution. This approximation breaks down for light nuclei
(hydrogen above all) and high-frequency vibrations, requiring more sophisticated
statistical sampling to compute accurate statistical and dynamical properties.

                :alt: This example shows how to estimate the heat capacity of liquid water from a path integral molecular dynamics simulation. The dynamics are run with i-PI, and LAMMPS is used as the driver to simulate the q-TIP4P/f water model.

                :alt: This notebook provides an introduction to multiple time stepping and ring polymer contraction, two closely-related techniques, that are geared towards reducing the cost of calculations by separating slowly-varying (and computationally-expensive) components of the potential energy from the fast-varying (and hopefully cheaper) ones.
