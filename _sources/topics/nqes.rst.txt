Nuclear quantum effects
=======================

Most atomistic simulations treat nuclei as classical particles, that sample a
Boltzmann distribution. This approximation breaks down for light nuclei
(hydrogen above all) and high-frequency vibrations, requiring more sophisticated
statistical sampling to compute accurate statistical and dynamical properties.

                :alt: This notebook provides an introduction to multiple time stepping and ring polymer contraction, two closely-related techniques, that are geared towards reducing the cost of calculations by separating slowly-varying (and computationally-expensive) components of the potential energy from the fast-varying (and hopefully cheaper) ones.

                :alt: This notebook introduces the calculation of tunneling rates using ring-polymer instanton rate theory. A comprehensive presentation of the instanton formalism can be found in the review article by J. Richardson, Int. Rev. Phys. Chem., 37, 171, 2018, while the implementation within i-PI is described in V. Kapil et al., Comp. Phys. Commun., 236, 214, 2020. Additional practical details are available in Yair Litman's doctoral thesis.
