models, or the pre-processing of data to optimize the model architecture or
data.

                :alt: This tutorial would go through the entire machine learning framework for the electronic density of states (DOS). It will cover the construction of the DOS and SOAP descriptors from ase Atoms and eigenenergy results. A simple neural network will then be constructed and the model parameters, along with the energy reference will be optimized during training. A total of three energy reference will be used, the average Hartree potential, the Fermi level, and an optimized energy reference starting from the Fermi level energy reference. The performance of each model is then compared.

Finally, we also generate a selection of the most important features using the same techniques.

            .. image:: ../examples/polarizability/images/thumb/sphx_glr_polarizability_thumb.png
                :alt: In this example, we demonstrate how to construct a metatensor atomistic model for the polarizability tensor of molecular systems. This example uses the featomic library to compute equivariant descriptors, and scikit-learn to train a linear regression model. The model can then be used in an ASE calculator. You could also have a look at this recipe based on scalar/tensorial models, which provides an alternative approach for equivariant learning of tensors.

                :alt: In this example, we demonstrate how to train a metatensor atomistic model on dipole moments and polarizabilities of small molecular systems, using a model that combines scalar descriptors with equivariant tensorial components that depend in a simple way from the molecular geometry. You may also want to read this recipe for a linear polarizability model, which provides an alternative approach for tensorial learning. The model is trained with metatrain and can then be used in an ASE calculator.

                :alt: Evaluating forces as a direct output of a ML model accelerates their evaluation, by up to a factor of 3 in comparison to the traditional approach that evaluates them as derivatives of the interatomic potential. Unfortunately, as discussed e.g. in this paper, doing so means that forces are not conservative, leading to instabilities and artefacts in many modeling tasks, such as constant-energy molecular dynamics. Here we demonstrate the issues associated with direct force predictions, and ways to mitigate them, using the generally-applicable PET-MAD potential. See also this recipe for examples of using PET-MAD for basic tasks such as geometry optimization and conservative MD, and this for an example of how to use direct forces to accelerate training.

                :alt: This example demonstrates a "conservative fine-tuning" (or equivalently, "non-conservative pre-training") strategy, to train a model using a (faster) direct, non-conservative force prediction, and then fine-tune it in back-propagation force mode to achieve an accurate conservative model.

                :alt: This tutorial introduces a machine learning (ML) framework that predicts Hamiltonians for molecular systems. Another one of our cookbook examples demonstrates an ML model that predicts real-space Hamiltonians for periodic systems. While we use the same model here to predict a molecular Hamiltonians, we further finetune these models to optimise predictions of different quantum mechanical (QM) properties of interest, thereby treating the Hamiltonian predictions as an intermediate component of the ML framework. More details on this hybrid or indirect learning framework can be found in ACS Cent. Sci. 2024, 10, 637âˆ’648. and our preprint arXiv:2504.01187.
