Unfortunately, as discussed e.g. in this paper, doing so means that forces are not conservative, leading to instabilities and artefacts in many modeling tasks, such as constant-energy molecular dynamics. Here we demonstrate the issues associated with direct force predictions, and ways to mitigate them, using the generally-applicable PET-MAD potential. See also this recipe for examples of using PET-MAD for basic tasks such as geometry optimization and conservative MD, and this for an example of how to use direct forces to accelerate training.

                :alt: In this tutorial, we calculate the SOAP descriptors of an amorphous silicon dataset using featomic, then compute the local prediction rigidity (LPR) for the atoms of a "test" set before and after modifications to the "training" dataset has been made.

                :alt: This example uses featomic and metatensor to compute structural properties for the structures in a training dataset for a ML potential. These are then used with simple dimensionality reduction algorithms (implemented in sklearn and skmatter) to obtain a simplified description of the dataset, that is then visualized using chemiscope.

                :alt: In this example, we demonstrate how to construct a metatomic model for flexible three and four-point water model, with parameters optimized for use together with quantum-nuclear-effects-aware path integral simulations (cf. Habershon et al., JCP (2009)). The model also demonstrates the use of torch-pme, a Torch library for long-range interactions, and uses the resulting model to perform demonstrative molecular dynamics simulations.
