PLUMED
======

PLUMED is an open-source, community-developed library that provides a wide range
of different methods, which include enhanced-sampling algorithms, free-energy
methods, tools to analyze the vast amounts of data produced by molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. These techniques can be used in combination with a
large toolbox of collective variables that describe complex processes in
physics, chemistry, material science, and biology. Documentation, examples and
installation instructions for the various packages are discussed on the `PLUMED
website <http://plumed.org>`_.
