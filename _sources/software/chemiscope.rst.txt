chemiscope
==========

Chemiscope is a tool for interactive exploration of databases of materials and
molecules, correlating local and global structural representations with the
properties of the systems. Chemiscope files can be viewed `online
<https://chemiscope.org/>`_, generated using a `python library
<https://pypi.org/project/chemiscope/>`_ and used inside jupyter notebooks or
sphinx documentations, which is how it's used in the cookbook examples. You can
check the `documentation <https://chemiscope.org/docs/>`_ and the `github
repository <https://github.com/lab-cosmo/chemiscope>`_.

                :alt: This notebook analyzes the structures of 264 polymorphs of ROY, from Beran et Al, Chemical Science (2022), comparing the conventional density-energy convex hull with a Generalized Convex Hull (GCH) analysis (see Anelli et al., Phys. Rev. Materials (2018)). It uses features computed with featomic and uses the directional convex hull function from scikit-matter to make the figure.

These are then used with simple dimensionality reduction algorithms (implemented in sklearn and skmatter) to obtain a simplified description of the dataset, that is then visualized using chemiscope.

                :alt: This notebook provides an introduction to multiple time stepping and ring polymer contraction, two closely-related techniques, that are geared towards reducing the cost of calculations by separating slowly-varying (and computationally-expensive) components of the potential energy from the fast-varying (and hopefully cheaper) ones.

Habershon et al., JCP (2009)). The model also demonstrates the use of torch-pme, a Torch library for long-range interactions, and uses the resulting model to perform demonstrative molecular dynamics simulations.

This example uses the featomic library to compute equivariant descriptors, and scikit-learn to train a linear regression model. The model can then be used in an ASE calculator. You could also have a look at this recipe based on scalar/tensorial models, which provides an alternative approach for equivariant learning of tensors.

You may also want to read this recipe for a linear polarizability model, which provides an alternative approach for tensorial learning. The model is trained with metatrain and can then be used in an ASE calculator.
