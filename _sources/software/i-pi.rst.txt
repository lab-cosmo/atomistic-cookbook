i-PI
====

i-PI is a universal force engine interface written in Python, designed to be
used together with an ab-initio, machine-learned, or force-field based
evaluation of the interactions between the atoms. You can see learn more about
it on the `ipi-code website <http://ipi-code.org>`_, the `documentation pages
<http://ipi-code.org/i-pi>`_ or `the github repository
<https://github.com/i-pi/i-pi>`_.

Habershon et al., JCP (2009)). The model also demonstrates the use of torch-pme, a Torch library for long-range interactions, and uses the resulting model to perform demonstrative molecular dynamics simulations.

                :alt: Evaluating forces as a direct output of a ML model accelerates their evaluation, by up to a factor of 3 in comparison to the traditional approach that evaluates them as derivatives of the interatomic potential. Unfortunately, as discussed e.g. in this paper, doing so means that forces are not conservative, leading to instabilities and artefacts in many modeling tasks, such as constant-energy molecular dynamics. Here we demonstrate the issues associated with direct force predictions, and ways to mitigate them, using the generally-applicable PET-MAD potential. See also this recipe for examples of using PET-MAD for basic tasks such as geometry optimization and conservative MD, and this for an example of how to use direct forces to accelerate training.
