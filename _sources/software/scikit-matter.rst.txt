scikit-matter
=============

scikit-matter is a toolbox of methods developed in the computational chemical
and materials science community, following the scikit-learn API and coding
guidelines to promote usability and interoperability with existing workflows.
You can get the latest version from its `github repository
<https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/scikit-matter>`_ and learn how to use
it from its `documentation <https://scikit-matter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

                :alt: In this tutorial we generate descriptors using featomic, then select a subset of structures using both the farthest-point sampling (FPS) and CUR algorithms implemented in scikit-matter. Finally, we also generate a selection of the most important features using the same techniques.

                :alt: This notebook analyzes the structures of 264 polymorphs of ROY, from Beran et Al, Chemical Science (2022), comparing the conventional density-energy convex hull with a Generalized Convex Hull (GCH) analysis (see Anelli et al., Phys. Rev. Materials (2018)). It uses features computed with featomic and uses the directional convex hull function from scikit-matter to make the figure.

                :alt: In this tutorial, we calculate the SOAP descriptors of an amorphous silicon dataset using featomic, then compute the local prediction rigidity (LPR) for the atoms of a "test" set before and after modifications to the "training" dataset has been made.

                :alt: This example uses featomic and metatensor to compute structural properties for the structures in a training dataset for a ML potential. These are then used with simple dimensionality reduction algorithms (implemented in sklearn and skmatter) to obtain a simplified description of the dataset, that is then visualized using chemiscope.
