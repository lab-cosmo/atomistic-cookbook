LAMMPS
======

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics (MD) code, with a focus on materials
simulations. It includes a wealth of interatomic potentials, and of basic and
advanced molecular simulations techniques, and is highly parallelized using an
efficient domain decomposition scheme. Learn more about LAMMPS on its `homepage
<https://www.lammps.org>`_.

                :alt: In this example, we demonstrate how to construct a metatomic model for flexible three and four-point water model, with parameters optimized for use together with quantum-nuclear-effects-aware path integral simulations (cf. Habershon et al., JCP (2009)). The model also demonstrates the use of torch-pme, a Torch library for long-range interactions, and uses the resulting model to perform demonstrative molecular dynamics simulations.
