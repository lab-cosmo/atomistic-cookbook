featomic
=========

`featomic` is a library for the efficient computing of features for
atomistic machine learning also called “representations”, 
“descriptors” or “fingerprints”. These features
can be used for atomistic machine learning (ML) models including
ML potentials, visualization or similarity analysis. You can learn how to use it
reading the `documentation <https://metatensor.github.io/featomic>`_, and get the latest
version from the `github repository <https://github.com/metatensor/featomic>`_

                :alt: This example uses featomic and metatensor to compute structural properties for the structures in a training dataset for a ML potential. These are then used with simple dimensionality reduction algorithms (implemented in sklearn and skmatter) to obtain a simplified description of the dataset, that is then visualized using chemiscope.

                :alt: This tutorial would go through the entire machine learning framework for the electronic density of states (DOS). It will cover the construction of the DOS and SOAP descriptors from ase Atoms and eigenenergy results. A simple neural network will then be constructed and the model parameters, along with the energy reference will be optimized during training. A total of three energy reference will be used, the average Hartree potential, the Fermi level, and an optimized energy reference starting from the Fermi level energy reference. The performance of each model is then compared.

Rev. Materials (2018)). It uses features computed with featomic and uses the directional convex hull function from scikit-matter to make the figure.

Finally, we also generate a selection of the most important features using the same techniques.

You may also want to read this recipe for a linear polarizability model, which provides an alternative approach for tensorial learning. The model is trained with metatrain and can then be used in an ASE calculator.
