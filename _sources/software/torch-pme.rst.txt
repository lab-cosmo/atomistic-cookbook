torch-pme
=========

`torch-pme <https://lab-cosmo.github.io/torch-pme/>`_
provides a modular implementation of classical algorithms
for the evaluation of long-range interactions (e.g. Ewald,
particle-mesh Ewald - PME, and P3M). 
It can be used to build traditional electrostatic models,
as well as long-range descriptors for machine-learning
applications.

                :alt: In this example, we demonstrate how to construct a metatomic model for flexible three and four-point water model, with parameters optimized for use together with quantum-nuclear-effects-aware path integral simulations (cf. Habershon et al., JCP (2009)). The model also demonstrates the use of torch-pme, a Torch library for long-range interactions, and uses the resulting model to perform demonstrative molecular dynamics simulations.
