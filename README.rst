This repository contains the source code for the Atomistic Cookbook,
a collection of software recipes to perform computer simulations of
matter at the atomic scale. The content of the cookbook
is automatically compiled and deployed as a GitHub pages site,
accessible at https://atomistic-cookbook.org

You usually don't need to clone the whole repository if you want to try
a recipe: the files needed to execute one, as well as the environment
description, can be downloaded from the corresponding page.
You should get the entire repository if you want to build all recipes
locally, or if you want to use it as a template for your own cookbook.
