The COSMO cookbook contains recipes for atomic-scale modelling for materials and
molecules, with a particular focus on machine learning and statistical sampling methods.
Rather than focusing on the usage of a specific package (see the `COSMO github page
<https://github.com/lab-cosmo>`_ for a list of available tools, and their
documentations) this cookbook provides concrete examples of the solution of modeling
problems using a combination of the various tools.
