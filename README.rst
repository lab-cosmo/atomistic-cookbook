This cookbook contains recipes for atomic-scale modelling for materials and
molecules, with a particular focus on machine learning and statistical sampling methods.
Most of the examples rely heavily on software developed by the laboratory of 
computational science and modeling (COSMO, see the `COSMO github page
<https://github.com/lab-cosmo>`_) but the cookbook is open for recipes using 
all types of modeling tools and techniques. 
Rather than focusing on the usage of a specific package, this cookbook provides concrete 
examples of the solution of modeling problems using a combination of the various tools.
