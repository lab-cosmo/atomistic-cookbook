COSMO Software Cookbook
=======================

`COSMO Software Cookbook <https://software-cookbook.rtfd.io/>`_

.. marker-intro-start

The COSMO cookbook contains recipes for atomic-scale modelling for materials and molecules, with a particular focus on machine learning and statistical sampling methods.
Rather than focusing on the usage of a specific package (see the `COSMO github page <https://github.com/lab-cosmo>`_ for a list of available tools, and their documentations) this cookbook provides concrete examples of the solution of modeling problems using a combination of the various tools.
