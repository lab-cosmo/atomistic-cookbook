This cookbook contains recipes for atomic-scale modelling for materials and
molecules, with a particular focus on machine learning and statistical
sampling methods.
Most of the examples rely heavily on software developed by the laboratory of
computational science and modeling (COSMO, see its `github page
<https://github.com/lab-cosmo>`_) but the cookbook is open for recipes using
all types of modeling tools and techniques.
Rather than focusing on the usage of a specific package, this cookbook provides
concrete examples of the solution of modeling problems, often using a combination
of several tools.
