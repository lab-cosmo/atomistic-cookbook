Atomistic Cookbook
==================

This repository contains the source code for the Atomistic Cookbook,
that is automatically compiled and deployed as a GitHub pages site,
accessible at https://atomistic-cookbook.org

.. marker-intro-start

The cookbook contains recipes for atomic-scale modelling for materials and
molecules, with a particular focus on machine learning and statistical
sampling methods.
Most of the examples rely heavily on software developed by the laboratory of
computational science and modeling (COSMO, see its `github page
<https://github.com/lab-cosmo>`_) but the cookbook is open for recipes using
all types of modeling tools and techniques.
Rather than focusing on the usage of a specific package, this cookbook provides
concrete examples of the solution of modeling problems, often using a combination
of several tools.

You can view the recipes online, compiled as webpages containing explanations,
code snippets, plots and interactive viewers based on 
`chemiscope <https://chemiscope.org>`_. However, it is also possible (and 
hopefully simple) to download scripts, and environments, to run the recipe
on your computer, and that you can use as a starting point to adapt them  
to your own use case.
